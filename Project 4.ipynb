    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem set, you'll implement two versions of a wordgame!\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't be intimidated by the length of this problem set. There is a lot of reading, but it can be done with a reasonable amount of thinking and coding. It'll be helpful if you start this problem set a few days before it is due!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by describing the 6.00 wordgame: This game is a lot like Scrabble or Words With Friends, if you've played those. Letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words out of their letters. Each valid word receives a score, based on the length of the word and the letters in that word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules of the game are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing\n",
    "A player is dealt a hand of n letters chosen at random (assume n=7 for now).\n",
    "\n",
    "The player arranges the hand into as many words as they want out of the letters, using each letter at most once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some letters may remain unused (these won't be scored).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring\n",
    "The score for the hand is the sum of the scores for each word formed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The score for a word is the sum of the points for letters in the word, multiplied by the length of the word, plus 50 points if all n letters are used on the first word created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on. We have defined the dictionary SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES that maps each lowercase letter to its Scrabble letter value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, 'weed' would be worth 32 points ((4+1+1+2) for the four letters, then multiply by len('weed') to get (4+1+1+2)*4 = 32). Be sure to check that the hand actually has 1 'w', 2 'e's, and 1 'd' before scoring the word!\n",
    "\n",
    "As another example, if n=7 and you make the word 'waybill' on the first try, it would be worth 155 points (the base score for 'waybill' is (4+1+4+3+1+1+1)*7=105, plus an additional 50 point bonus for using all n letters).\n",

    "**Please read this problem entirely!!** The majority of this problem consists of learning how to read code, which is an incredibly useful and important skill. At the end, you will implement a short function. Be sure to take your time on this problem - it may seem easy, but reading someone else's code can be challenging and this is an important exercise.\n",

    "Representing hands\n",
    "\n",
    "A hand is the set of letters held by a player during the game. The player is initially dealt a set of random letters. For example, the player could start out with the following hand: a, q, l, m, u, i, l. In our program, a hand will be represented as a dictionary: the keys are (lowercase) letters and the values are the number of times the particular letter is repeated in that hand. For example, the above hand would be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "hand = {'a':1, 'q':1, 'l':2, 'm':1, 'u':1, 'i':1}    \n",
    "Notice how the repeated letter 'l' is represented. Remember that with a dictionary, the usual way to access a value is hand['a'], where 'a' is the key we want to find. However, this only works if the key is in the dictionary; otherwise, we get a KeyError. To avoid this, we can use the call hand.get('a',0). This is the \"safe\" way to access a value if we are not sure the key is in the dictionary. d.get(key,default) returns the value for key if key is in the dictionary d, else default. If default is not given, it returns None, so that this method never raises a KeyError. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> hand['e']\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",

    ">>> hand.get('e', 0)\n",
    "0\n",
    "Converting words into dictionary representation\n",

    "One useful function we've defined for you is getFrequencyDict, defined near the top of ps4a.py. When given a string of letters as an input, it returns a dictionary where the keys are letters and the values are the number of times that letter is represented in the input string. For example:\n",

    "Generating a random hand\n",
    "\n",
    "The hand a player is dealt is a set of letters chosen at random. We provide you with the implementation of a function that generates this random hand, dealHand.

For example, the player could start out with the following hand: a, q, l, m, u, i, l. The player could choose to spell the word quail . This would leave the following letters in the player's hand: l, m. Your task is to implement the function updateHand, which takes in two inputs - a hand and a word (string). updateHand uses letters from the hand to spell the word, and then returns a copy of the hand, containing only the letters remaining. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> hand = {'a':1, 'q':1, 'l':2, 'm':1, 'u':1, 'i':1}\n",
